&bull; Simon consists of four large light-up buttons: red, green, blue, and orange.<br>
&bull; The game creates a sequence of tones and lights by illuminating these buttons in a specific order.<br>

&bull; If you press buttons in correct sequence then you will be promoted to next level else GAME OVER !<br>
&bull; As the game progresses, the sequences become longer and more challenging.<br>
&bull; Note : This version is a little bit different from the traditional version of Simon's game in the following manner :-<br>
  1.This is my modified version,where at every level new set of button will flash and you have to repeat it,while in traditional version after level up only 1 button flashes
    and you have to press all the previous one's before pressing the newly flashed button.<br>
  2.For level 1,1 button will flash ,for level 2 random buttons will flash and so on ....<br>
